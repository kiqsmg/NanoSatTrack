## Overview

NanoSatTrack serves as a platform with the primary goal of making data generated by nanosatellites accessible to the general public. It achieves this by offering a website equipped with interactive dashboards. These dashboards play a vital role in presenting and visualizing the key telemetry and information derived from the satellite's mission interface. In essence, NanoSatTrack enables anyone to conveniently access and understand the valuable data produced by nanosatellites.
It is responsible for creating a dashboard showing the communication between the earth (a ground station) and a satellite, that are divided in two sub-modules: Beacon and downlink/uplink.

## Downlink page

The downlink page shows all the connections that ground stations have made with the satellite while on orbit, every single downlink connection is listed here.</p>

## Batteries page

The batteries page is an environment dedicated to showing all the information we collect about our Energy Power System.</p>

## Solar Panels page

The solar panels page is an environment dedicated to showing all the information we collect about the 6 modules of solar panels we have in the CubeSat..</p>

## Locations page

The locations page is a map that allows us to see all the countries that made contact with the Cubesat while in orbit. We only obtained this much data thanks to several Ram radio operators and partner institutions around the world! </p>

## Groundstation code

The ground station code is a side project to complement the Nanosat tracker, focused on the ground station side. Although we have received many connections with our Cubesat around the world, it's hard to send all the data to our database, this project also came to solve this problem making it easier for the Ham radio operators around the world to send the satellite data to our database by developing a code that automatically sends the received beacon data to our MongoDB platform. </p>

## Releases

The NanoSatTrack software releases is synchronized in order to garantee compatibility. Then, using diferent versions might lead to unpredictable behavior.
