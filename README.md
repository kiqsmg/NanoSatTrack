## Overview

NanoSatTrack serves as a platform with the primary goal of making data generated by nanosatellites accessible to the general public. It achieves this by offering a website equipped with interactive dashboards. These dashboards play a vital role in presenting and visualizing the key telemetry and information derived from the satellite's mission interface. In essence, NanoSatTrack enables anyone to conveniently access and understand the valuable data produced by nanosatellites.
It is responsible for creating a dashboard showing the communication between the earth (a ground station) and a satellite, that are divided in two sub-modules: Beacon and downlink/uplink.

## Downlink page

The downlink page shows all the connections that ground stations have made with the satellite while on orbit, every single downlink connection is listed here.
